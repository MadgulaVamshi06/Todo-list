Utilizing React's useState hook, I efficiently manage the state of the application, including tasks, task input, and filtering options.
I've implemented intuitive user interactions by providing functionalities such as adding tasks, toggling completion status, and removing tasks.
The application dynamically updates the task list based on the selected filter (all, active, or completed), enhancing user experience and usability.
By integrating basic CSS styles, I've ensured a visually appealing and cohesive presentation of the Todo List interface.
